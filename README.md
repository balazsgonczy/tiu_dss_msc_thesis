### Abstract:

Tabular data is still an unconquered area of deep learning where professionals claim that advanced decision trees dominate the prediction tasks. This context is where deep learning models like TABNET try to overcome this prediction challenge. According to the literature, we can find broadly varying results claiming Xgboost or other deep learning models to be the ultimate go-to model. Also, in the case of tabular employee retention prediction, Human Resource (HR) professionals usually have limited small data, like just a thousand instances. Here the application of deep learning models becomes more interesting. Therefore the current study compares Randomforest, Lightgbm, Xgboost and TABNET on three different publicly available small Employee Retention (ER) datasets. Alongside the application of these models, the study will also apply Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, like Permutated Feature Importance (PFI) metrics and Ceteris paribus based Partial Dependence Plots (PDP). Using these XAI tools, we can enhance the global and local interpretability of the models, as mentioned earlier. The results suggest that there is no clear dominating model. Thus, instead of searching for a rule of thumb, experts should always try different quick approaches before in-depth hyperparameter tunning the best-performing model.
