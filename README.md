### Abstract:

Tabular data is still an unconquered area within the field of deep learning where professionals’ research like Shwartz-Ziv’s shows that advanced decision trees dominate the prediction tasks. This context is where deep learning models like TABNET try to improve upon this prediction standard. According to the literature, broadly varying results can be found claiming Xgboost or other deep learning models to be the best performing go-to model. Also, in the case of tabular employee retention prediction, Human Resource (HR) professionals usually have a limited amount of data, only a few thousand instances. Here the application of deep learning models shows room for performance task improvement. Therefore, the current study performs the Random Forest, Lightgbm, Xgboost and TABNET models on three publicly available employee retention datasets limited in size. Alongside the application of these models, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies are also applied within this study, like Permutated Feature Importance (PFI) metrics and Ceteris paribus based Partial Dependence Plots (PDP). Using these XAI tools, the global and local interpretability of the models can be enhanced, as mentioned earlier. The results point towards that there isn’t any clear dominating model. Thus, instead of searching for a rule of thumb, experts should always try different quick approaches before in-depth hyperparameter tuning of the best-performing model.
